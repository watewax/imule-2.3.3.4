= Accessing via subversion =

* First install svn, and launch a command like :

{{{
svn help
}}}

This should create a configuration directory in your home directory, something like ''~/.subversion''.

* Edit the ''servers'' file in this directory, and tell svn to use your i2p proxy for sites of the ''i2p'' domain.


''file : ~/.subversion/servers''
{{{
[groups]
eepsites = *.i2p

[eepsites]
http-proxy-host = 127.0.0.1
http-proxy-port = 4444
http-compression = yes
}}}

* Then checkout the iMule repository :

{{{
svn co http://www.imule.i2p/svn/iMule/trunk iMule-trunk
}}}

This will create the ''iMule-trunk'' directory with iMule sources.

* When you want to update to the latest revision, enter the ''iMule-trunk'' directory, and launch :

{{{
svn update
}}}

* If you want to be able to commit changes, send an email with the username and the password you wish to the address [mailto:mkvore@mail.i2p].
