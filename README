This is a rough merge down of iMule changes over to the aMule git repository of 2019/07/15.

ASIO is untested and won't work in iMule, do not use.


Some directories have not been fully tested:
- platforms
  - Windows
  - MacOSX
- po (translation files have not been updated)


TODO:
- check back on every files until EncryptedStreamSocket.cpp for muleSocketFlags replacing wxSocketFlags
- check back on amuleIPV4Address replacing wxIPaddress -> we'll have to keep wxIPaddress for now
- we might have a problem with GetPeer() that got redefined(?) in LibSocket.h, but gets overloaded by wxI2PSocketClient.h, see EncryptedStreamSocket.h line 281? Although the arguments should pick the right definition -> I think they just used GetPeer() while testing Asio and using LibSocket.h there.
- we might have a big set of problems from the changes in ListenSocket.cpp
- have reverted back to config dir checking in OtherFunctions.cpp, we don't have CConfigDir class anymore.

NOTES:
nothing is working currently. The compilation succeeds but the linker gives some errors. No idea how to fix that right now.
